This project isn't finish yet

I want to make an Add-in for Excel to generate the QR-Code of a cell/range of cells
If I can implement everything I have in mind the add-in will be able to :
  -Generate a QR-Code Version 10 
  -Set the correction level
  -Set the type of input data (numeric, alphanumeric, binary)
  -Set the mask wanted
  
The QR-Code will be able to contain until 513 numerical, 311 alphanumerical or 213 binary carracters
(for a Medium correction level)
For more information about masks, correction level ... Please refer to the "Ressources" folder.
